<li id="c01-ex-0055" class="calibre8">Ed has been hired by a private company to connect two remote sites with a Wide Area Network (WAN). Each of these sites has more than 200 users, and they all need to constantly transfer files across the WAN. One of the sites has a customer database that is accessed by both sites at all hours of the day. Access to the database and other information is time sensitive and constant. The company estimates that their aggregate bandwidth needs to be approximately 40 Mbps. Management says that they need to guarantee access to this information and that money is not a factor in the WAN implementation. Which WAN technology should Ed recommend for this scenario?

As a telecommuting employee, he needs to connect to the company network to access client information, transfer files, and send email through a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Ralph is investigating the different Wide Area Network (WAN) services available for the remote connection before he implements one. His home is over 30 years old; the existing telephone wiring was not run through conduit, and the wiring seems to be deteriorating. Ralph has cable television (CATV) service, and his home is also approximately 20,000 feet from the nearest telephone central office. He wants to implement the fastest remote connection service possible, but cost is a factor in the decision. Which WAN technology should Ralph implement?

The company president has asked him if it is possible to run their Gigabit Ethernet network using two of the wire pairs in the cable, while using the other two pairs for telephone connections. Ralph is not sure, so he sets up a lab network using cables with only two pairs connected. When he plugs computers into the switch and turns them on, the Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) labeled 1000 light up, indicating that a Gigabit Ethernet connection has been established. Ralph gets excited at the thought of how much money he might save the company by using the same cable for both telephone and data. However, while the LED is lit, he cannot seem to connect to another system over his test network. Which of the following describes what he must do to correct the problem?

The router has a switch module containing four Ethernet ports, all of which are assigned to the default VLAN1. When you plug a laptop into one of the Ethernet ports, you can access the Internet with no difficulties. You now need to connect the ADSL router to the company network so that the Wireless Access Points (WAPs) on the network can provide users with Internet access through the ADSL router. However, when you plug the router into a network switch port that is assigned to VLAN4, the switch starts generating “Native VLAN mismatch detected” errors once every minute. Which of the following steps should be part of the solution you implement to stop the error messages from appearing? (Choose all that apply.)
